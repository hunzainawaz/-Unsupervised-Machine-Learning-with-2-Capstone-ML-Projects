# -Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-with-2-Capstone-ML-Projects
This project will let you take step by step into the world of Unsupervised Machine Learning. Unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition. It will cover all common and important algorithms and will give you the experience of working on some real-world projects.
